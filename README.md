# Regression EC with LSTM and MIMIC-III Dataset

## Goal
In this experiment, we were interested in assessing regression error consistency with an LSTM, responsible for forecasting in the form of temporal predictions at varying prediction offsets into the future.

## Implementation
A simple 1-layer LSTM with a hidden size of 32, and a final linear layer was used in this experiment.


## Model Train 

```
sh submit_regression_ec.sh
```
